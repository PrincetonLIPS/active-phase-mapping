Data: contains CSVs detailing performance of various search methods. There should be a separate CSV for each search method. 
Figs: contains comparison plots for various search methods.  
Scripts: various search methods plus helper functions. 
Scripts starting with 0-4 are all different search methods. They just differ in how they make decisions. 
0—chooses points randomly
1—chooses the point that is farthest from all other points. Here, the farthese point is one whose whose nearest neighbor is farthest. 
2—baseline active search that learns about the energy surface, not the convex hull.
3—one version of convex hull aware active search. I calculate the information entropy using a “mean-field” approach where I treat the compositions separately. This was simpler and easier to iterate with as I built up figures.
4—CHAASE, but with Diana’s method for calculating joint entropies.
